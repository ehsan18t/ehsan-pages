- ALWAYS DO PROPER RESEARCH, USE MCP OR INTERNET OR ANY OTHER TOOL TO GATHER CONTEXT BEFORE PROCEEDING.
- ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU ARE UP TO DATE WITH THE LATEST STANDARDS AND BEST PRACTICES OF THE CONTEXT.
- ALWAYS MAINTAIN TODO TO TRACK OF PENDING TASKS.

- I use bun as package manager, Tailwind CSS for styling, and React for building user interfaces.
