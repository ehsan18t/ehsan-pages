        "Working with Ehsan has been an excellent experience. I asked him to build a desktop app for my gold testing business, and he delivered far beyond my expectations. Not only does the app generate professional certificate cards and manage my database smoothly, but he also patiently handled all the changes I requested—even when it meant rewriting major parts of the app. On top of that, he integrated an offline AI-powered background remover for images, which was a game-changer for my workflow. His dedication, technical skill, and willingness to go the extra mile convinced me to immediately hire him again for another project. Truly outstanding work!",
